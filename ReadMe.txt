1. Run the aml_monks python file, it generates the confusion matrix and accuracy plots for the 3 train and test file.
All the depths from 1 to 8 are used in generating the accuracy plots
2. Run the aml_own python file, it generates the confusion matrix and prints the decision tree for depths 1 and 2. Depths 1 to 15 are used to generate the accuracy file.
